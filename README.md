# GenericNVMeName
A codeless kext that patches the NVMe controller to rename it to Appleâ€™s native one or something else

## Feature
...
## Supported OS
- macOS High Sierra (10.13) to macOS Sonoma (14)
## Usage
1. Download from releases.
2. Click on `GenericNVMeName` and choose `Show Package Contents`.
3. Click on the `Contents` folder.
4. Edit `Info.plist`.
5. Find `IOPCIPrimaryMatch` under `IOKitPersonalities\com.AppleOSX.GenericNVMeName`.
6. To find `IOPCIPrimaryMatch`, you should use Hackintool to find the NVMe `Vendor` and `Device` ID.
7. For example, if your `Vendor` ID is `0xAAAA` and `Device` ID is `0xBBBB`, then you should combine both like this: `0xbbbbaaaa` (all in lowercase) and fill it into `IOPCIPrimaryMatch`. It also supports multiple NVMe by separating with a space like `0xbbbbaaaa 0xddddcccc`. In my case, my `Vendor` ID is `0x8086` and `Device` ID is `0xF1A8`, so my `IOPCIPrimaryMatch` is `0xf1a88086`.
### [Optional]
- You can change the NVMe controller name by changing the `Vendor Name` and `Chipset Name` in `Info.plist`.
