6. To find your `IOPCIPrimaryMatch`, you should use Hackintool to find the NVMe `Vendor` and `Device` ID.

> [!WARNING]
> - For example, if your `Vendor` ID is `0xAAAA` and `Device` ID is `0xBBBB`, then you should combine both like this: `0xbbbbaaaa` (all in lowercase) and fill it into `IOPCIPrimaryMatch`.
> - It also supports multiple NVMe by separating with a space like `0xbbbbaaaa 0xddddcccc`
> - In my case, my `Vendor` ID is `0x8086` and `Device` ID is `0xF1A8`, so my `IOPCIPrimaryMatch` is `0xf1a88086`.
### [Optional]
- You can change the NVMe controller name by changing the `Vendor Name` and `Chipset Name` in `Info.plist`.

> [!CAUTION]
> - I **think** the members and owners of ChefKiss Inc **shouldn't** use this kext. Why? Because Visual **will** say `Do not use this kext because it will inject some useless information and just only for comestic, etc...`. So, is that true? We still don't know because I've been banned from both Telegram and GitHub by ChefKiss (Visual)
